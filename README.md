# tasks.chara.dev

A SvelteKit-based website for my functional and colorful tasks app.

_Looking for the [mobile app](https://github.com/19lmyers/tasks-kmm)
or [server backend](https://github.com/19lmyers/tasks-backend)?_

## Objectives

After my work with server-side SvelteKit on my portfolio website, I decided to create a client-side SPA in SvelteKit for
my tasks app.

Note that this project is still a work in progress.

## For developers

For code linting before each commit, change the project's git hooks directory with this command:

```shell
git config core.hooksPath hooks/
```

You can also copy the contents of /hooks to your project's git hooks folder.
